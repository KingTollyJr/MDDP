# MDDP Code

The files are all a bit of mess. 
The 'shape.py' was an early version that doesn't really do much - it was just an area where I tested ideas.
TestPolygons.py was mainly written by ChatGPT3 and is just where I tested certain functions and methods before applying them to the main scripts.
Similarly, with both pickstuff.py and Pickle.py - these were just scripts that I could use that would turn a shapefile into a pickle file and do some prelim analysis

Drones.py and LandRADARv2.py are the two that actually contributed to the real analysis that was done. This code was for a group project at University and so the python files other than these two, are just to demonstrate work done and some methods. The full code for Drones.py file will take a long time to complete, I have added 'save places' so that it can be run in sections and then saved so edits can be made to the end of the script and run again without it taking ages. Both of these files will write their results to csvs or plot the results.
